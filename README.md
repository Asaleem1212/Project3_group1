# COVID-19 Vaccination and Outcome Analysis

## Introduction
This project analyzes the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and vaccination status. The analysis focuses on demographic factors such as age group and race, and geographically across different states within the United States.

## Data Sources
The datasets used include:
- COVID-19 case data from the United States
- COVID vaccination data
- Cumulative vaccine data

## Methodology
The steps taken in the analysis include:
- Importing the necessary libraries and data.
- Summarizing total deaths and vaccinations by state.
- Merging the datasets on state names to examine relationships.
- Creating visualizations such as bar plots and scatter plots.
- Handling missing values and adding state abbreviations for mapping.

## Results
The analysis reveals the following key findings:
- Total deaths and vaccinations are summarized by state.
- The relationship between COVID-19 deaths and vaccination records is visualized using scatter plots with regression lines to show trends.
- Vaccination records are aggregated and plotted by age group and race to explore demographic factors.

## Conclusion
The project provides insights into the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes across different demographics and states. Further research could delve into more detailed demographic analysis or examine the effects over time as more data becomes available.
